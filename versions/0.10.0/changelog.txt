# Changes

- The modpack now features preconfigured Quick Menu with many common actions, like nearest item identifier, blacksmith, Wynntils menu and so on 
- Changed default keybinds. This change will only affect new installs. By default, drop key will be unbound and in its place Quick Menu will be activated. Further keybind changes will happen in later updates
- Fixed an issue where the background in settings menu was covering the game
- Updated links in main menu
- Complementary Shaders now will again have their original name, this means you will need to redo your settings but only one time as long as you use Complementary shader with Euphoria Patches which are now included
- Legendary Tooltips and all mods that previously were removed due to Iceberg/Prism incompatibility are added back
- Removed some unneeded files
