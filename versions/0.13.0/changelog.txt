## What happened
After some time after the last update I lost access to my Modrinth account thus lost access to all my projects. Because of that I lost all motivation to work on the pack and other projects. Thankfully I tried to work it out with Modrinth Support, I tried to make it the best possible for you the user and the best thing has happened that I didn't know would, they actually recovered the access to the account allowing me to coninue to work on my projects here. I was so happy that I was even so motivated to try my hand at modding and as you can see, I made a new dedicated mod for the pack, it is my first mod and as such I must thank the Wynntils Team so much as they helped me get it to work, without them I would definetly give up.
