This is a really long overdue update. I apologize to everyone who kept waiting, as this should be done much sooner. This version updates the game to 1.21.4 which is the only currently supported version of Wynntils, meaning you have been not getting any important updates through this time, again, my apologies. Sadly, the transition came with a few issues that sadly meant some mods had to be hopefully temporary removed, Most notably the new incompatibility between Wynntils and Distant Horizons, thus DH had to be removed until the issue is resolved. Without further ado, let's get over to the changelog.

## Big thanks to Palette for doing the majority of the work!

  - Due to changes in Fancy Menu, the player model was replaced with a static image.
