This is a really long overdue update. I apologise to everyone who kept waiting as this should be donem much sooner. This version updates the game to 1.21.4 which is the only currently supported version of Wynntils, meaning you have been not getting any important updates through this time, again, my apologies. Sadly, the transition came with a few issues that sadly meant some mods had to be hopefully temporarely removed, Most notably the new incompatybility between Wynntils and Distant Horizons, thus DH had to be removed until the issue is resolved. Without further ado, lets get over to the changelog.

## Big thanks to Palette for doing the majority of the work!
